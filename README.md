# PII_Test_Data
Quick program for creating test data that focuses on PII. 

Uses faker ([https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/](URL)) to create the fake data. Uses the terminal/console for user input (which is required). 
Has a progress bar to show you how long the script will need to run. It also has an embedded warning for any file size over 5MB - likely anything over 20MB will take a fair bit.
